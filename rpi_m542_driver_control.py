# 1. This is the setup for the Nema 23 stepper motor with M542T Driver. 
# 2. After each stepper movement call, the relative location of the stepper motor, in teeth with repsect to the gear, is written to a file. 
# 3. Move by step or by tooth

# TODO: attach a hall sensor to the arm and a fixed location on the table. Call an initialization() method that scans the entire the table. When the hall sensor is triggered, carefully stop the arm and slowly back up until the hall sensors are lined up again. This location will be fixed and will be tooth 0.
